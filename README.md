Hi there 👋 I'm a React Developer with a hunger for learning 📚 and implementing new things 💻. I believe in writing clean 🧼 and understandable code 🤓 and building scalable web applications that solve real-world problems! 💡

Currently, I'm working on an open-source e-commerce app called Kicks 👟, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases my coding practices and style, and you can check it out on its GitHub repo 🌐

In addition, I have experience working on several projects that have helped me hone my skills 🛠️. For instance, I played a key role in developing the UI of the Low Cost Drugs website, which was built with Next.js. I also built the complete website for Visiata using Next.js and handled both the UI and CMS of V-management, which was built with Webflow.

If you're looking for help with your front-end development needs, I'm always available for a call and discussion ☎️. I love to use Data Structures and Algorithms in real-life projects, and I'm always open to new learning opportunities 🚀.

Let's work together to create stunning web applications that can make a difference! ✨
